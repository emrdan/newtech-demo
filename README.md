To run the React app:

  - change to frontend directory (cd frontend)
  - run npm install
  - run npm install -g json-server (fake API based on JSON files)
  - run npm start
  
To run the express app:

  - change to backend directory (cd backend)
  - run npm install
  - run node app.js 
  
Note: The express app might not run as I didn't have time to test it. I just coded it and started focusing on the frontend with a fake api to do rapid prototyping.


This is project is incomplete given the instructions by Newtech.

The time constraint and my other responsibilities didn't allow me to invest more time into this. Additionally, I took the risky decision of not to use any abstractions like React Router, Formik (form validator) or UI frameworks like Semantic UI/Material Design.

The idea behind my decision was to prove you that I can build a React app without any abstractions. As developers, we often rely too much on abstractions without understanding how things work under the hood. I wanted to reflect responsibility using plain React.

Downsides

  - I had to do everything from zero (with very limited time)
  - The CRUD is not complete as I didn't get time to write the create, edit and delete functions from the fake API.
  - No UX
  - No Mobile Responsive
  - Backend code was put together but still have to test it
  - No comments nor instructions
  - The React app is using a fake db with JSON SERVER.
  
I wish I could have shown you other projects of mine or at least discuss one of your own. I think this kind of 'homework' doesn't reflect my capabilities or domain knowledge as a software developer. In fact, I think this makes for a poor candidate experience.

Anyway, feel free to explore the code and run the react app. If interested, let's analyze any other of my projects or one of yours. Contact me at emrdan@gmail.com
